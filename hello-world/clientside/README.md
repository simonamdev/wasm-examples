# Hello World (client-side)

This example allows us to run the already compiled wasm file in the browser.

## Pre-requisites

[Emscripten SDK](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk)

## Running

To run, simply run the following command:

`make`

Then access the file `hello.html` at `http://localhost:8000`.

If you are not on a Linx/Mac system, look into the Makefile to see the exact command that needs to be run.
